Yes, I have several.  Really? Please, tell me more about your hobbies.  Well, I do like to collect things.  Really? What do you like to collect?  I like to collect stamps.  Really? Where do you collect stamps from?  I collect stamps from all over the world.  Why do you do that?  Because eventually I hope to have a stamp from every country.  Why do you want all of those stamps?  I think it's because I won't be able to go to those countries myself.  Oh, what is another hobby of yours?  I collect beer.  Pardon me? You collect beer?  Well, actually I collect beer cans.  Okay, where do you get the cans from?  From every place that I travel to.  Do you drink the beer?  Nah, I'm not a beer drinker.  Oh, I see.  What about you? What are your hobbies?  Well, I like to read a lot.  Really? What do you read about?  I like to read about bestsellers, and I like to read a lot about science too.  What kind of science do you read about?  A variety of topics, but I especially like to read about nature and about electronics.  Fascinating. Why do you like to read so much?  Well, I think it helps me exercise my brain.\",\n    \"timestamp\":{\n      \"start\":\"0:00:13\",\n      \"end\":\"0:02:20\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker\":\"SPEAKER 2\",\n    \"content\":\"That's a good reason, if it doesn't make you too tired.
